# Reinforcement-Learning
Implementation of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms, mainly in openAI gym

### Algorithms Implemented so far:
* Q-learning with Softmax Action Selection: qlearn.py
* Q-learning with e-greedy Action Selection: qlearn2.py
* SARSA with with Softmax Action Selection: sarsa.py


### Evaluations:
* qlearn2.py: https://gym.openai.com/evaluations/eval_S6ldgxysSay2eidRk9eHNA
* sarsa.py: https://gym.openai.com/evaluations/eval_D7pDK88ESHCdiZR7YZeqMQ

### Running:
openAI gym, numpy, and python3 are required to run any of the programs.
To run enter: `python3 filename.py` on command line
